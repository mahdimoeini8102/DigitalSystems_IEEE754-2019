# DigitalSystems_IEEE754-2019
This is the last (6th) project of the Digital System course at the university under the supervision of [Dr. Zainalabedin Navabi Shirazi](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~navabi). In this project, I have implemented a complete multiplier system base on [IEEE 754-2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766229) using SystemVerilog HDL(Hardware Description Language) and then I have synthesized them using [Intel® Quartus® II](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiSyaGylN-AAxWyg_0HHRvBAs0QFnoECB0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsoftware-kit%2F666221%2Fintel-quartus-ii-web-edition-design-software-version-13-1-for-windows.html&usg=AOvVaw3QVPl63a7llUDFiBNAMJ3K&opi=89978449).

# About IEEE 754-2019
## Abstract
This standard specifies interchange and arithmetic formats and methods for binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic in computer programming environments. This standard specifies exception conditions and their default handling. An implementation of a floating-point system conforming to this standard may be realized entirely in software, entirely in hardware, or in any combination of software and hardware. For operations specified in the normative part of this standard, numerical results and exceptions are uniquely determined by the values of the input data, sequence of operations, and destination formats, all under user control.
## Scope
This standard specifies formats and operations for floating-point arithmetic in computer systems. Exception conditions are defined and handling of these conditions is specified.
## Purpose
This standard provides a method for computation with floating-point numbers that will yield the same result whether the processing is done in hardware, software, or a combination of the two. The results of the computation will be identical, independent of implementation, given the same input data. Errors, and error conditions, in the mathematical processing will be reported in a consistent manner regardless of implementation.
